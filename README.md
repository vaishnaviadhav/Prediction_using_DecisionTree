# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
This work is from my internship project as the Data Science and Business Analytics intern at The Spark Foundations, Singapore.
The Iris flower dataset is used to predict the class of an iris flower using Decision Tree Algorithm

## Problem Statement
Create the Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
